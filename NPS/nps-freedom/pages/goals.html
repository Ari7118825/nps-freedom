			<h2>
				Our Goals
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our main goal to make EVERYTHING availible to EVERYONE hence the name NPS Freedom!<br>
				We do this by making the one and only TRULY UNBLOCKABLE website!!! And soon by finding the unfortanate and giving to them.<br>
				We also have a catalog of any movie and game! We give adless access to verified torrents of any game and any movie.
				And all of this is to provide for those who can't get these resources from where they are, be it in a different country, inside a school or office setting, we will always find a way to provide our services.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Our Rules
			</h2>
			<p>
				We have our 100% transparency policy, we will always tell our customers how we provide our services and answer any questions and concerns they have.<br>
				When using our services we are not liable and or responsible for any sort of trouble that you may or may not get into by using our services.<br>
				Be it watching a movie in class or playing a pirated video game. Now it may sound illegal for us to be able to make this website but based off of research and looking at similar websites we have found it is not illegal.<br>
				This means you are able to use our services and as long as you are only using the unblocking feature and not downloading files that are licensed and would require a payment you cant get into legal trouble unless where you are using our services says otherwise.<br>
				This also depends on what country you live in so be weary and do some reseach before using our services.
