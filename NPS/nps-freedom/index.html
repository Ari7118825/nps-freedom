				Our Unblocked Index
			</h2>
			<p>
				This is a webpage that has a catalog of movies and html games, this website is 100% unblockable due to it being self hosted.<br>
				Don't get me wrong the weblink and DNS can get blocked but due to this website being availible on GitHub means you can download it to a usb stick and plug that into a computer and run the website off of that.<br>
				The movies technnically can be blocked but it would be incredibly hard to and or it would shut down the core mechanics of the system if they blocked it.<br>
				This is because the movies are hosted on OneDrive which is the core component of many companies.
