# nps-freedom
The GitHub Download for the unblockable website NPS-Freedom


This website contains a number of availible things to do from browser proxies to games and movies all unblockable

# Download and Start-Up
To make this website an offline file you need to download this repository.
You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button and clicking "Download ZIP"

Once the file finishs downloading you need to unzip the package so open file manager on your computer and unzip the file
A folder called NPS will now be availible

Get you USB stick of choice minimum of 4Gb and move the folder onto the USB stick

# Using the offline website
To use the offline website from a USB stick you need to plug it into a computer and then go into files and go to the USB
From there you need to open the NPS folder and inside you will find a file called "index.html"
Open that and it will open in a browser and there you go

#Failure
If even after all of these steps of downloading to a USB stick and using the website that way and it still doesn't work, you can look up an HTML online IDE and then copy the code into the IDE
What you can do if you can go through the files and folders and then if your looking to play games find the game folder and copy all of the files into this online IDE and play that way
If after all of this it still does not work please contact me at my email : pookieloser.001@gmail.com
